# Montgomery County Traffic Collision Project
### Overview
This project analyzes over 195,000 traffic collision records from Montgomery County, using police-reported crash data.
The dataset contains detailed information on:

- Crash date & time

- Road & environmental conditions

- Driver behavior (distraction, impairment, fault)

- Vehicle information

- Injury severity

- GPS coordinates

- Speed limit & road type

The goal is to identify collision hotspots, dangerous driving behaviors, and environmental risk factors, and provide recommendations to improve roadway safety.

## Project Goals

- Identify high-risk locations, roads, and intersections

- Determine peak crash hours and peak days

- Analyze collisions by weather, speed limit, light conditions, and vehicle make

- Study behavior-specific crashes such as distracted driving and impaired driving

- Understand patterns in injury severity

- Provide data-driven safety insights
## Technologies Used
- Python

- pandas

- matplotlib

- seaborn

- Visualization

- Tableau

- Jupyter Notebook
## Key Visual Analyses

This repo includes visual charts for:

- Accidents by Speed Limit

- Accidents by Hour

- Accidents by Vehicle Make

- Accidents by Area

- Injury Severity Levels

- Distracted Driving Crashes by Hour

- Accidents by Weather Condition

These visualizations help identify strong patterns and correlations across driver behavior, environmental factors, and crash severity.
## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

To measure safety outcomes, this project uses:

### Crash Reduction

- Lower frequency and severity over time.

### High-Risk Location Identification

- Recognition of crash clusters and hotspots.

### Driver Behavior Insights

- Patterns for distraction, impaired driving, and speeding.

### Emergency Response Optimization

- Insights into times/locations where faster responses matter most.
## Actionable Insights & Recommendations
### 🚧 Infrastructure Improvements

- Better signage at high-risk intersections

- Improved lighting in low-visibility areas

- Road design enhancements where crashes cluster

### 📚 Education & Outreach

- Campaigns focusing on distracted and impaired driving

- Safe-driving programs during peak crash hours

### ⚖️ Policy & Enforcement

- Targeted enforcement of speed limits

- Stronger DUI monitoring

- Emphasis on distracted driving laws
## 🏁 Conclusion

The analysis reveals clear patterns, such as:

- Peak hours and peak days for collisions

- Higher injury risk under impaired driving

- Specific areas with high crash density

- Weather and light conditions that correlate with crash likelihood

- A breakdown of driver distractions and their timing

These insights can be used by transportation departments, policymakers, and safety organizations to improve road safety in Montgomery County.
